**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to segment customers of a retail store using K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm. By grouping customers based on purchasing behavior, retail businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better suit the needs of different customer segments.

**The project involves:**

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Identifying the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method
* Performing K-means clustering
* Visualizing the clusters in a 2D space using PCA
* Dataset

**The dataset contains information about customers, such as:**

* CustomerID
* Gender
* Age
* Annual Income (k$)
* Spending Score (1-100)
**Note: The dataset is included in this repository as Mall_Customers.csv.**
